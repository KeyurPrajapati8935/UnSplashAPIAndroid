# UnSplash API Kotlin

I utilized the UnSplash API to load beautiful images in an Android Kotlin application & applied with pagination.

## Project structure (MVVM)

```project_root
├── data
│   ├── model            Placeed data models
│   └── repository       Placeed repository implementation
├── network              Place network related classes
├── ui

```

## Run the code : 

##  Prerequisites:

1. Make sure you have Android Studio installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Ensure that you have a compatible Android device or emulator set up for testing. You can create a virtual device using Android Studio's AVD Manager if you don't have a physical device available.

## Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal and run and perform below two steps:

Step 1 : git init

Step 2 : git clone https://github.com/KeyurPrajapati8935/UnSplashAPIAndroid.git

## Open Project in Android Studio:

Launch Android Studio.
Click on "Open an existing Android Studio project."
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the project folder.
Wait for Android Studio to import the project and download any necessary dependencies.

## Configure the Android SDK:
If prompted, ensure that the correct Android SDK is selected. You can do this by navigating to File > Project Structure > Project and selecting the appropriate SDK version.

## Build the Project:

Once the project is loaded, click on the "**Build**" menu and select "**Make Project**" to build the project.
Alternatively, you can press Ctrl + F9 for (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + F9 for (Mac) to build the project.

## Run the Application:

Click on the green play button in the toolbar or select Run > Run 'app' from the menu.
If multiple devices or emulators are connected, select the one you want to use for testing.
